[ ] Remove 'should_draw_entitiy_anyway' and just move drawing immediate stuff like drawing lines on triggers in fill_entities_draw_queue funciton where we already have full entities loop on draw call.
[ ] Think about more camera work towards keeping target between player end enemies so we could see them better. That could reduce cam blocker system for now, but this still be required later for visual purposes.
[ ] Make that line on player attack from $VISUAL$ section.
[X] On bomb blocks level last door don't open when bomb is exploded. (That's was because we detected that entity does not exist in trigger drawing aswell (wtf??). There still lyes connected entities removal. Should redo that shit).
[ ] Cam blockers system. Each blocker should be separate entity with direction (We could draw direction along like platforms). On trigger enter we will set which blockers we look upon. Maybe we want this blockers to be line-defined and we'll set on them block direction - east or west from line. We could make that camera will detect collisions with them by cam view border, but that propably will overcomplicate things as if we just make this similar to how cam rails currently works.
[ ] Remake tutorial about increasing gravity and write about that in text. 
[ ] Make text about spin stop on bridge1 level.
[ ] In shoting practice level we could introduce propellers. Also we could teach about spin stop here in safe environment.
[X] Jump shooter still doing dump shit while standing. (Made a 0.4 sec buffer before he restarts his grounded timer. Issue is fixed for now, but that could've mean that something wround with our collision system and when i'll want to continuously detect ground using get_nearest_ground_collision again - this will fail me aswell. We already planned task for improvents in collision plane so will look into that later).
[X] Add collisions to sword size required modifier.
[X] Try to remove player stun, will see what's happens. (Maked it depends on app time instead of game time, so in death instinct it has a chance to recover. We'll see how it goes).
[X] Make spin practice easier (last room).
[ ] Hotreloading. 
[X] Try to make that sticky textures don't go out of screen. (Tried. Could go that path later.).
[\]? Lights bugs sometimes on copy. Still broken, but we'll remake all light storing so not an serious issue for now. Also could be that it breaks levels for some reason. Or maybe levels breaks for other reason and it's break light at the same time. scary day...
[X] We're loading on temp levels for some reason. (That was because we were entering editor state on every occasion and editor state makes us loading on temp level, but saving temp level from real content happening on entering game state. We should think about how we make that transisioning better.)
[X] Fix sound when enemies kill themselves on player touch. 
[X] Add text on tutorials. We'll make it that firstly and will remove text when we'll understand that base mechanics is understandable at all.
[\] Плохо понимают в принципе механику вращения. Попробуем поправить это изменением партикла на экране - он будет идти по горизонтали, потому что только это имеет значение. (That should be clear when we'll make sounds for spin).
[X] Очень плохо пониается разница между большим и маленьким мечом. Стоит добавить не только разные партиклы на раскрут, но и звуки чтобы было понятней. Также надо будет побыстрее вводить ребят которых можно бить только большим или только маленьким мечом чтобы про разные мечи не забывали. We'll make sounds later, - for now we'll introduce this modifications for big/small sword kill immediately on big sword introduction.
[X] Возможно стоит быстрее переходить к экшону и вообще избавиться от этих секций с показом разных модификаторов. Возможно лучше это делать прямо на врагах когда придет время. For sure we should reduce stupid shit without action. Any new mechanic should be tested immediately. On first level we should immediately introduce blockers and make a few small arenas with birds. Well that could be not first level so we can make checkpoints, but point is clear.
[X] Shooting mode should not be disrupted by just holding spin button.
[X] First chasing section make better.
[\] Better introduce centipedes. We should explicitly make player to walk on it probably.
[\] People can't notice shoot stoppers and just forget about them even if noticed. We need to do something about it. We should draw icon above player when he can't shoot. 
[X] Make shoot blocker draw arrows.
[X] Make machinegun only after first shoot.
[X] Make Blocker direction bigger on low zoom.
[X] Playtest 02.06.25:
    [X] On first level better things.
    [X] On second kill player less. Less spikes.
[X] Think about how we should teach machinegun thing. We'll see what's up on playtests - if player just notice it by themselves means it'll work when we add some visual and sound clues when it's charging. (Solution in long term section - we'll make a room after tutorials where show all stuff and player could just understood).
[X] Think about that we could embrace a really big amount of bullets and make machinegun mode that will activate on shoot hold.
[ ] Enemy waves functionality
[ ] Maybe should draw new clue for player when birdies charging attack - this could be a red line that gets wider.
[X]! We should strongly slow down time when bird is about to kill player so he can react. This could be on a time-cooldown.
    [X] Detect a reason for instinct and disable it if, for example, sword no longer will hit explosive. Also disable if we will kill some thing. And if we spend too little time in instinct - no cooldown.
[X] Change way we draw all editor stuff to immediate and draw this in separate pass, so it won't be affected by light.
[\] Maybe we should put more effort to teaching how to stop sword and why it's useful. (After extensive thinking i decided that we put LESS effort to teaching how to stop sword - i just don't push player to know this annoyingly, but we still have this thing in bridge1 level where player need to stop sword while escaping wall of spikes, but this in level begin so don't scary).
[X] Don't forget to write string lib modifications before pushing. Should add n|o|c|h|e|c|k|i|n functionality.
[ ]? Booster for full invincibility.
[X] Jump buffer and coyote time
[X] Doors in editor should draw their opened position if they closed and closed position if they opened.
[\] Think on way to stop on the wall?
[X] Notes on levels.
[X] Test level reload.
[X] Check next/previous level load
[X] Think about how we should control/block dynamic camera. Blockers seems to complicated, so maybe some rails system will be not only good enough, but also really cool. (We should just change (localvariable) target position in update camera for that to happen)
[X]! Multiple autosaves
[X] Try white flash on whole background
[ ] One-frame arena for stuff like strings. Should also change string lib for that
[X] Make that explosion won't damage anything if behing obstacle
[ ]? When time comes - Make that wall climbing was on timer and resets when ground touched (or also when enemy killed with sword). UPDATE: Actually we might just make slippery walls, but we'll see.
[X] Weird bug when reloading by pressing T in game after dying. Lights seems not to unload; (That was because dummy entities is hidden and we don't updated their position when reloading. Need to think about should be show light on hidden objects or not). (we should not)
[X] Color picker for lights
[X] Color changer changes real color of object when works with light on one entity
[X] On lightmap drawing - draws all entities and not occludes (not all but not that we care about)
    [X] Occluding on lightmaps occludes real shadowcast geometry. Related ↑.
[X] Move sequence option for speeding up / slowin down depending on distance to player (so fast when far and slow when near)
[X] Fix texture misplacing on screen resizing
[X] Drag player with mouse (G)
[X] Birds delay before attack so they go in order.
[X] Space partitioning for collision detection. Static grid i think. (HUGE optimization)
[X] Explosion radius visualization (so player could understand what would happen when explosion hits)
[X] Jump off the wall
[X] Fixed physics timestamp (240)
[X] Free cam in game-mode (SHIFT+SPACE)
[X] Static camera functional
[X] Make that bullet hit only alive centipede segments
[X] Centipede option for which side's spikes on (?)
[X] Centipede customize segment size
[X]! Custom cursor
[X] Timer
    [X] One level speedrun and whole game speedrun. Whole level speedrun will put us in game start if we die.
    [X] Timer will be on screen up. If it's level speedrun - above timer will be level name. If we die - timer stops and turns red. If we win: then timer stops and turns green.
    [X] We need to add command for next level, first and last. (We don't know yet our last level, but it will be possible when we'll make proper level order)
    [X] We will tell info about speedrun commands after last level. So we need to know what our last level and first level.
[X] Try to give player control on sword size
[X] Fix blockers
[X] Sword color when can go into rifle
[X] Change sword acceleartion in air and test it
[\] Try to improve vertical movement by making throwable sword. 
[\] Temporal boosters for sword size and infinite ammo (?)
[X]! Wall climbing
[X]! Bird rework
[\] Bomber enemy
[X] Centipede
[X] Bullet for every x enemy
[X]! Scaling fix (Suka ne doljno) (budet)

<OPTIMIZATIONS>
[ ] Make raycast smarter. Actually whould just make a real ray-polygon intersecion and not that shit that de do now. Also circle-polygon etc. General physics improvements required.
    [ ] Also in collisions we want to look at that problem that we had with jump shooter standing state - get_nearest_ground_collision sometimes failed us and we did not get same result on every frame so we can't rely on such continuous checks, but we may want to; Should look into that.
[ ] Check what's up with light drawing, we have way to many draw calls.

<LONG TERM>
///////////////////////////////////////////////////
[ ] Really strong lighting with shadows and reflections/refractions
[ ] Particles rework
[ ] Per-object motion blur
[ ] Dynamic decals
[ ] Simulating only visual entities for fps more than fixed. Better later so less friction because simulation for visual guys should not make something catastrophical.
    - Made basic version of this - we just moving entities by their velocity and rotating some things, but that's not enough for final cut. Good enough for now. 05.02.2025.
[ ] Profiling tool.
[ ] Player internal-interface (for examplelines that shows how to kill sword-blocker) could be disrupted by some enemy. Funny visual requiered and pretty long gameplay before introduction so player could get used to this information.
[ ] Zone in late-game that will make sword not spin continuously, but react to sharp mouse movements to make cuts and fast dashes.
[ ] After tutorials we should make a long room splitted horizontaly where player will go in down part and in upper part will go player clone with recorded inputs to show player how cool he can play. By that we also hint some mechanics like a machinegun. 
///////////////////////////////////////////////////

<Levels order>
[X] Basic spining movement
[X] Basic shooting/triggers (also some immortal blockers)
[X] Big sword tutorial and more blockers
[X] Blocker turorial. Also propeller introduction
[X] Air movement (Down key for gravity 1)
[X] Explosive level
[X] More air movement, fast escape from wall and wide propeller slowing introduction
[X] Arena
[X?] Escape level with need to stop spinning ?. + arena (bridge1 level as arena and escape sequence is ok, but we might not want to force player stop sword spinning so early)
[X] Centipede
[X] Rope blocks
[X] Jump shooters introduction + more rope blocks. (There on vertical section we can try to make shoot blockers enemy-blocks with modifier that requires spin for longer than just one hit. This could be general thing for that kinds of blocks)
[X] Big bombs sections. Teaching that be can hide from explosions.
[ ] Arena section with explosions involved. Also hiding behind centipedes.
<Level ideas>
///////////////////////////////////////////////////
[X] On centipede's first introduction should be enemy that blocks shooting so dude could learn what centipede are
[ ] Big bomb in the middle and static camera. There should probably be multiple single-screen arenas or we could think about spawning bombs, but i don't think it's good. Also there should be flying blocks that will protect us.
[X] Tutorial for gravity increase - spikes above
[X] Cool physics rope block introduction with static camera where we need to cut it and go down
[ ] Ascending level (spikes go from below) where in parts we need to climb centipedes (and there's no real blocks). 
[ ] One-screen survival level
[ ] Small fast centipedes with full spikes on
[ ] Big centipedes without spikes that will act like a bridge. That may be escaping sequence, where we'll need to hop on centipedes, rope blocks etc.
[ ] Escape sequence with constant big explosions and we need to hide below blocks
[ ] Room with one explosive birdie, but we can't shoot (because of shoot stoper!!)
[ ] Extreme action sequence with invincibility booster.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////

<Battle ideas>
///////////////////////////////////////////////////
//WITH EXISTING:
//NEW:
[ ] Robo-hand that can catch us and throw somewhere
[ ] Charging stations where we need to spin. Also some enemies could charge of that and we can overcharge them.
[X] Block on the rope that can be cutted. (Maybe really **physics** objects on ropes that can be cut. So we can cut bombs, blocks etc.)
[ ] Killable objects for buffs (like homing shot, etc. Already that could be bombs, but big bombs is dangerous for player so we work on explosion radius (maybe show radius to player(done)) or make special bombs that damage only enemies and we can do other funny stuff with it)
[X] Enemy that doesn't allow to shoot
[ ] Spiky enemy (Could do that we don't want to kill it in range, but in melee)
[X] Shooter jumper
    [X] Base, animations, movement, shooting, interactions with player (kill him, die from him)
    [X] Respond on shooting
    [X] Options for projectiles
    [ ] Indication of bullets that will be shot above head
[ ] Катается по блоку туда сюда
[ ] Враг который триггерится на активированную винтовку. Сам почти невидимый и меняется когда чаржится.
[ ] Modifier for enemies so they can be killed with big or small sword.
[ ] Враг/Модификатор . Делает врагу больше хп, но убить можно только если быстро нанести много урона. С мечом нужно крутиться на враге некоторое время (например 1.5 секунды), а с выстрелом настрелять много за короткое время. С мечом круче всего звучит, нужно будет реально подзадержаться на типе и такое можно использовать для боссов. Тяжело будет работать с птичками, но дуабл. Вероятно придется подумать еще над тем чтобы было легче оставаться на месте при сильном вращении, потому что в воздухе точно если будешь крутиться в одну сторону и жать кнопку ходьбы в другую - вращение меча перевесит. Показываться это будет полоской над врагом, которая будет заполняться при нанесении урона и убавляться когда некоторое время не дамажишь.
[ ] Surface that when hit with sword - sword stoppes and player stucks in thing. 
///////////////////////////////////////////////////

<VISUAL>
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
[ ] For sure should make a wind. Wind could be a important in telling the directions aswell. At least we can make that debris will fly with wind. We could make some semi-physical visual elements that would react to wind. We need spesial line-like wind particles. They could use some sort of fluid simulation.
[ ] Maybe mirrors and something to do with them? Maybe someone that we can see only in mirror. Maybe mirrors play with light.
[ ] Snow with light blinks
[ ] On enemy attack we can briefly show line that will fade away
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

<RAW>
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
[ ] Maybe levels with static camera where world will wrap around, like in 'world turns red' or that item in duck game?
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
