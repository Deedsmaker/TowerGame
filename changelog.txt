19.02.2025: 
    - Base version of camera system that tries to keep enemies in sight. Needs a lot of improvements, but that will be happening overtime, like happened with death instinct.
    - There was a real try on this climbing insane shit, but now it's really too complicated of a mechanic in this game. BUT now we should think about another speedboost for player so he really can hunt down these dogs. Or not...

18.02.2025:
    - Made that small temp lights don't make shadows and backshadows.
    - Added buffer for death instinct where it will check if enemy flying towards in first 0.5 sec where we won't start cooldown.
    - In shooting_practice level added last room with spin stop tutorial.

17.02.2025:
    - Made that lights that coming from enemy modifiers comes from always draw loop and that sticky texture queues them. Also sticky texture lines now goes there so we don't keep real sticky texture entity on player position.
    - Removed sticky texture from dead enemies and also we don't go in stun if hit dead enemy wrong way.
    - Birds attacking line (xaip).

16.02.2025:
    - Now we draw external lines of entities in separate entities loop that happen when we fill entities draw queue.
    - Made that enemy modifiers no longer draw lines passively. That's because lines is powerful tool to communicate information to player so we don't want too many of them constantly. We may want to highlight these modifiers more, like with light blobs.
    - Made some immediate mode for lights. First step to improving lights and also handy tool for highligting some entities. Right now we highlight blockers and sword size required guys.

13.02.2025:
    - Changed jump shooter blocker direction rendering to immediate, so it does not get affected by light.
    - 'fixed' jump shooter jiggle entering standing state by adding 0.4 sec buffer for air time. That's an issue with collision system and we'll look into that. Task is already in do-list.
    - Simplified player collisions with enemies when he can damage them.
    - Shooting practice level work. Last room left where we'll teach to stop spin.

12.02.2025:
    - Some more death instinct improvements.
    - Big sword practice level work. Should finish this today. Finished.
    - Shooting practice level markup.
    - Made player stun depends on app time instead of game time. That should give us more chance to recover on instinct error. We'll se how it goes. 
    - Added collisions to sword size required modifier.
    - Made last room in spin practice a bit easier.

11.02.2025:
    - Level work on tutorial practice.
    - Changed the way how death instinct works. Now timescale depends on distance to threat or to angle till explode in case of sword.
    - Maybe fixed some lighting entities copy bugs.

10.02.2025:
    - Fixed temp level loading issue. 
    - Fixed alpha with immediate stuff when lighting on.
    - Fixed sword kill sound when enemies kill themselves on player touch.
    - Maked text rendering in game (it's just notes).

09.02.2025:
    - Sword size required modifier for enemies.
    - Translated sticky texture to immediate drawing, so it's no longer affected by lighting.
    - Spin practice level.

08.02.2025:
    - Плейтест миша. 
    - Reduced delay to machinegun. This could make more accidential activations, but that should increase possibility of player to discover it. We may make a setting for increasing this delay.
    - Maked that after entering rifle mode you should press spin again to enter spin. That should help players understand sword modes.

07.02.2025:
    - Define for no editor mode.
    - Message at the end of the game for speedrun commands. Also message at death for restart key.
    - Sound on failed entering rifle mode and no ammo shoot try.
    - Level work on bombe level and made better shoot stoppers - now we can't pass through without killing them on all currrent levels.
    
06.02.2025:
    - Added scroll ability for create box and now we drawing texture preview on those.
    - Changed explosvie1 a little.
    - Added machinegun mode for rifle. Now just testing.
    - Changed collisions for work on dynamic array.
    - Playtest with kostet.
    - Now machinegun works after first shoot.
    - Arrows on shoot blockers.
    - On air tut1 made arrow pointing down, we'll see how it goes.
    - Blocker mark size won't shrink above 0.35 zoom.
    
05.02.2025:
    - Made that changing timescale in console will affect new time scale called "debug_target_time_scale". Also more tested our imaginary "updating" when on low timescale. Good enough for now.
    - Changed deleting in text input.

04.02.2025:
    - Improved death instinct a bit.
    - Increased centipedes size on bombe level. Should be easier to deal with explosives now.
    - Raycast thinking fixing.
    - Fixed performance issue with death instinct - seems like enemies was raycasting for really long distance for check if they should trigger instinct. Could look more on that later.
    - Changed air_tut level to have one group of enemies.
    - Added gives_ammo property in editor. Also changed inspector and saves for this.
