    - Improved death instinct a bit.
    - Increased centipedes size on bombe level. Should be easier to deal with explosives now.
    - Raycast thinking fixing.
    - Fixed performance issue with death instinct - seems like enemies was raycasting for really long distance for check if they should trigger instinct. Could look more on that later.
    - Changed air_tut level to have one group of enemies.
    - Added gives_ammo property in editor. Also changed inspector and saves for this.
